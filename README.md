# Welcome to the EU Business Wallet Initiative

## Background

Within the recent launch of the [Competitiveness Compass for the EU](https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/10017eb1-4722-4333-add2-e0ed18105a34_en) the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en) 
announced its plan to augment the existing legislation around digital identity and trust, as laid 
down in the eIDAS-regulation [(EU) No 910/2014](https://eID.AS) for example, by introducing the 
**European Business Wallet (EUBW)**, which is envisioned to complement initiatives around 
the [European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) and become the cornerstone of doing business simply 
and digitally in the EU, providing a seamless environment for companies to interact with all 
public administrations. 

## EU Business Wallet System Architecture

As outlined in the following figure and explained in a first [discussion paper](https://dl.gi.de/items/c1d7ff4a-374a-4c11-a81e-64c5cc607e04), 
the *EU Business Wallet* is embedded in a system architecture, with an overarching *Trust Framework* defined by the eIDAS-regulation 
[(EU) No 910/2014](https://eID.AS) and optionally additional *Verifiable Data Registries* as defined 
in pertinent standards created by [W3C](https://www.w3.org). 

![EUBW Architecture](/img/eubw.svg)

The EU Business Wallet is interacting 
* with [European Digital Identity Wallets (EUDIWs)](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home) for Business-to-Consumer (B2C) processes, 
* with EU Government Wallets (EUGW) for Business-to-Government (B2G) processes, 
* with other EU Business Wallets in Business-to-Business (B2B) processes,
* with embedded devices and machines in Business-to-Machine (B2M) processes,
* with employees in Business-to-Employee (B2E) processes and 
* it is integrated with existing services and data repositories. 

The EU Business Wallet is envisioned to play an important role within 
[Dataspaces](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/2025-1-RC1/), which are emerging within different domains and hence it has a *Data Plane* and a *Control Plane* 
in which there may be a variety of different protocols. Furthermore, the EU Business Wallet has a *Trust Plane*, which interacts with the different
providers, repositories and catalogues within the *Trust Framework*.

## Use Cases for the EU Business Wallet

The EUBW is expected to complement the EUDIW in order to support a large variety of use cases as outlined in the following.
Please do not hesitate to [suggest](https://github.com/eu-business-wallet/eu-business-wallet/issues)

the necessary protocols and data formats.

## Goal of the EU Business Wallet Initiative

To facilitate the trustworthy and interoperable implementation of the forthcoming European Business Wallet, 
the [go.eIDAS Association](https://go.eid.as/) has initiated the present initiative to pave the way for the European 
Business Wallet by preparing technical documents, which are planned to be provided as input for 
suitable standardisation bodies, such as [CEN](https://www.cencenelec.eu/), [ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/), [ISO](https://www.iso.org/), 
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)  and [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) for example.
